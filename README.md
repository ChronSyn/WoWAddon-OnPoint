> A WoW addon to prevent world quests from stealing focus from your world map pin marker

Ever been flying to a map marker in game, only to have some world quest decide to take focus? This addon stops that by automatically refocusing your world pin marker when a world quest appears.

There's no config options or commands for this addon. If you don't want the functionality provided by this addon, disable or uninstall the addon.
